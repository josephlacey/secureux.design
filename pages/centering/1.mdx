# Figuring out the Problem and Whether You Are The Person to Help Solve it

## Mapping the Ecosystem and Understanding the Problem

This chapter will outline the steps to take prior to launching a project that can help you better understand the environment in which you are creating and the community that it will impact. This is critical to the foundation of any project, as it is the basis of the framework that will enable your work to focus on a rights and equity-based approach.

Before starting any project, it’s important to consider the following questions: what is the problem, who are the users, what are you doing/making/creating, how will the project solve the problem, and are there any issues or risks that may arise in the future. And often the most important but overlooked question, are you the right person to be doing this. Being able to answer these questions honestly can help provide clarity on how to best approach a product, piece of software or software library, campaign, research report or even an article.

Given the increased attention to privacy, tools that promote personal security have expanded rapidly in the past few years to meet the market demand. However, many of the new products in the market are either hard to use or provide free-to-low-cost options that are easy to use but monetize the user’s data. For example, highly-secure tools for secure email transfer, like [PGP (Pretty Good Privacy)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy), or other similar email encryption software like [GPG](https://gpgtools.org/) or [Open PGP](https://www.openpgp.org/) are examples of privacy-focused tools that are inaccessible to the average person. To implement, they require a certain level of technical understanding that the average person has neither the expertise nor patience to learn. Alternatively, email tools like Gmail are easy for individuals to implement but are not secure for your data and personal information. There are constant trade-offs between privacy and usability and it’s important to consider which trade-offs are acceptable and which are not.

Ecosystem mapping, a term from the user experience design and service design world, looks at all potential factors involved with both the problem and solution you are providing within the environment you are working. To map out the ecosystem consider the following questions:
Who are the other activists, researchers, policy makers, and technologists working in your area? What are they looking at and why?
Who is left out of pre-existing technology, research, and ecosystem? How are they left out?
How can what we are making improve the ecosystem, build on the current research, and help fill out or correct any gaps in knowledge or software?
What accessibility and privacy considerations do we need to consider when working within this context?

[NDI’s Co/Act Human Centered Design for Activists](https://www.ndi.org/publications/coact-human-centered-design-activists) covers curriculum focused on creating powerful services, products, and campaigns. In the curriculum it highlights that “ecosystem mapping can help position your work and identify ways to improve or differ from similar projects, groups, or movements. In the design world, a key step is noting what is being done both poorly and well, and to take those notes into account to strengthen your product, service, or campaign.” The model of ecosystem mapping is the first step towards a human-centered design process and can be a pillar for how you position and differentiate your product throughout the design process.

#### Exercise 1: Mapping out the Ecosystem

> Materials you’ll need: A guide for Ecosystem mapping - NDI’s Co/Act (https://www.ndi.org/sites/default/files/3.%20Ecosystem%20Mapping.pdf) suggests centering how these points relate to your organization, mission, question or bandwidth, and then use specific points to start a conversation on issue areas.
>
> - We recommend building on this more, and mapping what are the gaps you see, what are the gaps that cannot be immediately fixed but should be. This could be changes in regulation, legislation, breaking up big tech, unionization, whatever. It’s important to outline these bigger issues that may seem unchangeable now but could be changeable later. In Human Rights Centered Design, it allows us to aim for the world we want to exist, while recognizing the reality of where we are.
>
> In a document or on notes write out the following:
>
> - What are the boundaries or edges of our ecosystem?
>   - What are the limits of the problem and project?
>   - For example, you could map an entire ecosystem around privacy focused texting apps by starting with ‘texting apps’ in general- from who uses them, on what platforms or devices, how old they are, how users find them, etc.
> - What is the issue you’re solving? Why does this ecosystem exist? What pains are being addressed, and for whom, at each stage?
>   - Be as intersectional and as global as possible. The ‘problems’ a user faces in a specific country are not universal problems.
> - Where does this ecosystem exist? Is it software, hardware? How does your problem and ecosystem potentially cause problems in the ‘offline world’? - What devices are involved?
>   Remember, online life is as real as offline, and often problems from the online world affect people in the offline world.
>   - For example, harassment can start online, but suddenly have offline ramifications. Swatting, or when the militarized police are called to a person’s house, was popularized in online harassment campaigns such as Gamergate, but materialized offline. Swatting occurs where a harasser places a ‘prank phone call’ so violent in nature that it causes the militarized police to be deployed to a location.
> - What are the actions that happen in the ecosystem or in your problem statement? List all of them out, from the macro to the micro.
>   - Example: If we look at the Slack communications platform as an example, the ability to form multiple new channels is a macro choice, but micro choices are the small things a user can do. Can a user block an individual, or mute an individual? Can they turn off global notifications, eg all sounds per a Slack workspace, or can they mute or turn off notifications per specific kinds of channels? Thinking through every point of interaction is key, from the really big things (like starting a Slack workspace) to the micro things, how easily can someone react or respond to one individual message in one of many Slack channels. All these decisions need to be mapped out and planned for. Remember, a bug is a feature until you fix it.

## Human Rights Centered Design

Human Rights Centered Design is a set of research, design, and product development methodologies that combine human centered design with human rights policy. It is a response to the global abuse of people’s privacy and rights online and off: internet censorship, bias in technology, online harassment, adversarial state actors engaging in cyberwarfare and many other events that degrade or challenge general human rights.

In Human Rights Centered Design, we center the activists, communities, and researchers who are doing the hard and necessary work to effectively respond to the needs and mitigate harms of the communities and users we are working with. Human Rights Centered Design needs to be considerate of the community's risks, actionable, rooted in reality, and solve problems in ways that work best for those you are designing for. By asking ourselves if we are the right people to be engaging in this problem solving and robustly testing our question, we can start creating more equitable, intersectional, feminist, and human rights focused work. You can test your questions about who is best to respond to the problem in Exercise 5 below. By iterating on our questions and using this kind of ‘threat modeling’, we can create a more inclusive and participatory space to work with those centered around the problem. It is crucial to acknowledge and integrate their hard work and unique contributions into the process, so you do not make assumptions, replicate their work, or eclipse their participation with your own presence. In the internet freedom community, we often remind each other to acknowledge who is here with you, and revisit this during each stage of your process.

In the ethos of acknowledging who is here with you, it’s important to recognize what others have done. Don't say you're doing something revolutionary when activists are actually already doing it or have previously implemented similar frameworks. Mapping the ecosystems helps paint a picture of all of the research and knowledge in a space prior to our contribution; our ecosystem mapping needs to include all different kinds of research, including: quantitative research, qualitative research such as first hand experiences, activists’ documentation, knowledge from communities, journalism, and technological research. Research and knowledge come in all shapes and sizes, and Human Rights Centered Design recognizes that knowledge doesn't just exist in academic settings but comes from local communities, activists, journalists and people. Ecosystem mapping allows us to see this bigger picture more holistically, which helps us to identify gaps-- but again, only if we are including all different kinds of knowledge.

## FOR THE NON HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVIST: Participatory Design and Working With a Community

It can, and often does, take years to properly invest in the communities you are working with. By building trusting and productive relationships with them that focuses on participatory and co-design, you can achieve this over time.

Engaging closely with communities you are trying to help can create vested relationships that make the product more usable. Additionally, centering marginalized voices ensures that you are truly making for a wide audience, and that your product, campaign, software, or research is thinking about all different kinds of use cases, not just a handful of use cases.

From Design Justice, “Ultimately, at its best, a design justice process is a form of community organizing. Design justice practitioners, like community organizers, approach the question of who gets to speak for the community from a community asset perspective. This is rooted in the principle that wherever people face challenges, they are always already working to deal with those challenges; wherever a community is oppressed, they are always already developing strategies to resist oppression. This principle underpins what Black feminist author Adrienne Maree Brown calls emergent strategy. Emergent strategy grounds design justice practitioners’ commitment to work with community-based organizations that are led by, and have strong accountability mechanisms to, people from marginalized communities. This contrasts with most other design approaches; even those that aim to involve users, citizens, or community members typically do so in a consultative process that ultimately is led by the professional designers.” (Costanza-Chock page 92)

## Things to Keep in Mind:

Previous academics and researchers have reminded us of the many pitfalls of design ideation, particularly when we over-insert ourselves into the problem or create solutions that aren’t needed.

One example we look to is from the Design Justice Book: Tech for Social Justice Project (T4SJ). A framework created by the Design Justice (and one we really love) was developed after interviewing practitioners, designers, researchers, developers, community organizers, and funders across the US to create recommendations on how to make better technology solutions with social justice in mind.

After talking with practitioners around the country, the T4SJ Project synthesized hundreds of concrete suggestions for community accountability into the following recommendations:

## Adopt Codesign Methods

This means spending time with a community partner, in their space, learning about needs, and working together through all stages of design. Usually, no new tech development is necessary to address the most pressing issues. Codesign methods have a growing practitioner base, but they could be better documented.

## Center the Community’s Needs over Tools

Community needs and priorities must drive technology design and development, and technology is most useful when priorities are set by those who are not technologists. Be humble and respect community knowledge. Process and solution should be driven by the community; do not make community members token participants.

#### Exercise 2: Why Are We Doing This? Who Do We Need to Talk to?

> These next two exercises are from an article written by Tricia Wang for Fast Company.
>
> - We recommend building on this more, and mapping what are the gaps you see, what are the gaps that cannot be immediately fixed but should be. This could be changes in regulation, legislation, breaking up big tech, unionization, whatever. It’s important to outline these bigger issues that may seem unchangeable now but could be changeable later. In Human Rights Centered Design, it allows us to aim for the world we want to exist, while recognizing the reality of where we are.
>
> Part One: Why Are We Doing This?
>
> In the Fast Company article, Wang interviews Project Inkblot co-founder, Jahan Mantin, on how Project Inkblot kicks off design sessions with their clients. Jahan has their clients ask: “Who the hell are we?” For our exercise, let’s ask “Who Are We” or “Why Are We Doing This?” In Wang’s article, Jahan needs her client to know the “different lenses our identities propel us to bring to the table because for better or worse our identities influence who we design for.” So, this is a moment to ask yourself and your team for introspection and list out “why are we doing this”? Does the community have the knowledge / tools to use our solution? Are we able to communicate clearly across cultures/languages? Are we co-designing in a way where the community can help infuse the project with their capacities and ensure it takes their disabilities or knowledge gaps into account? This is a time to reflect on our motives, wants, desires, and hopes for the project, how the community can benefit, and how to separate our ego from the process.
>
> Start by documenting answers to the following questions:
>
> - Why are we doing this?
> - What are we bringing to the table?
> - What can our organization/collective/group/individual do to help in this problem area?
> - What are our assumptions and blind spots?
> - What kind of knowledge, access, and intersectionality do we need to accomplish this project as equitably as possible?
> - Do we have a tie or deep connection to the subject matter we are exploring?
> - How are we meaningfully working with the community and not creating or furthering extractive practices?
>
> Part Two: Who Do We Need to Talk to?
>
> Use this prompt to recognize who are the people outside of our collaboration who need to be consulted, considered, and cited.
>
> - On a document, list out the other researchers, activists, and individuals you know about in this subject area, or the research that already exists in this area.
> - Once you’ve done that, try to highlight the gaps: who are the missing people you need to find, cite, reach out, etc. You can write down “we need to find a trusted local community member who has specific knowledge of the problem area you are addressing,” or “more on-the ground user testing” or “community partners in X region”, etc.

## Avoid Parachuting Technologists into Communities

In general, parachuting is a failed model. Don’t do it. Stop parachuting technologists into organizations or focusing on isolated “social good” technology projects, devoid of context, when the real need is capacity building. We are not saying “never bring someone in from outside a community.” … We do think that it is worthwhile to develop better models for sharing local knowledge with national groups and for national groups to share their perspectives with local groups in such a way that all parties can benefit.

## Stop Reinventing the Wheel

Well-meaning technologists often reinvent the wheel, without researching existing solutions. Designers, developers, and project leads, no matter what sector they are in, should begin projects by researching existing projects and organizations. This also stems from competitive, rather than collaborative, mindsets (“ours will be better, so we’ll just compete”). It is important to work together to develop shared tools and platforms, instead of only competing for scarce technology resources.”

#### Exercise 3: Checking Your Assumptions with Different Users

> Your product will have many users! If you have an idea of the potential user now, or have mapped what they are like, this is the time to start mapping how the project changes when they have different experiences or backgrounds. You should do this again in the personas chapter (chapter 6), but it’s always good to check your own assumptions and biases before you start a project. This is one of the exercises we have used in our own work to try to map out and understand our own hypotheses when starting any new projects. Even communities, who are experts about their needs, still make assumptions and have their own blind spots, too! This is why this is a helpful exercise to do while beginning your work.
>
> Start by thinking about one of your users. Change three parts of their identity and needs about them. Maybe it’s their location, language, gender, sexual identity, or device they use. Change their reasoning for using this software (or an aspect of how they relate to your problem statement).
>
> Here’s an example: if we were researching someone facing online harassment, perhaps a female journalist in the US who uses major social media platforms and faces gender based violence online. We could change our user to be-- a female journalist in Egypt reporting on politics who uses major social media platforms, and now faces online gender based violence, and pressure/censorship from different kinds of governmental agencies in her own country and abroad. Now make another: what happens if your journalist is also facing domestic violence or harm from someone they know, on top of the other harms they face?

#### Exercise 4: Building on your assumptions

> In this exercise, we are going to take some of the work from the previous exercises and build on it! This exercise has two parts to it.
>
> Part 1:
> On a piece of paper, a digital document, or post-it notes, create five different kinds of users with very different backgrounds. How does this change or complicate your problem statement or question? How does your product change for the new users? Are there potential risks that evolve and new challenges they encounter? (When you engage in research, validate this finding! Don’t make assumptions or create ‘personas’ without research but actually base your users on real people you’ve spoken to! But as one of the first things you do, it’s okay to make these lightweight personas to help expand and challenge your initial question or problem statement.)
>
> Part 2:
> In your document, list out all the different issues facing your five users from the above exercise. Create a document, list, or series of post it notes per user (so you will have five lists, five different documents or five stacks of post it notes). Now, list potential different examples or harms the users will face; what tools or software they are using; etc. Map out the problems, software, and experiences specifically to the users and see how they differ.
>
> Ask yourself:
>
> - How are these users different?
> - How will your project, research orp problem statement account for all of these different kinds of real world experiences?
> - Does your problem statement or research need to change, and how will you change it?
> - Does this challenge your assumptions?

#### Exercise 5: Are we the best people to embark on this project?

> In a document, list out the primary needs of the community you are working with (i.e., what problems do they need to solve?). Narrow these problems down to those you feel you may be capable of helping with.
>
> Ask Yourself:
>
> - Have you ensured whether this is the 'right' problem to solve?
> - Is your 'problem' statement equitable, pulling from social justice, design justice, or human rights? Does it consider marginalized communities and support them?
> - Do you have consent and trust to engage with the project, contribute to research? Is the topic something the stakeholders care about and need support with?
> - Have I ensured that the community you are working with is the primary stakeholder/beneficiary? Can you work freely with them to address their problem without being constrained by financial, political, social, or other influences?
> - Do you speak the language of the community you are working in? Are there risks involved in collaborating with you?
> - Have you done your due diligence in research that looks at a variety of sources, and centers safety, privacy, and human rights centered design?
> - Have you assessed your community's threat model (this is outlined in Chapter 3 for how to do this)?
>   - You’ll be doing this more in-depth, but for now, think about all the potential threats your community could be facing

#### Exercise 6: Make sure you are ready to move forward

> See if you're ready to progress beyond the initial question and introductory research phase by checking the following boxes. If you check ‘no’ for more than 3, you may not be the right person for this job and will need to find someone closer to the community to fill this role.
>
> - I have done a comprehensive environmental scan of the problem and the community spaces I am addressing
> - I have created an ecosystem map that includes everyone, and everything involved and affected by this project
> - I have full support and investment from the community I am working with
> - I have applied an intersectional lens to ensure I’m asking the right question(s)
>   - I am ensuring that my question is intersectional in nature
> - I am in contact with a number of different NGOs and CSOs who work in this area
> - I have looked at how this problem affects many different communities in the Global South
> - ...and I have ensured that my problem or hypothesis isn’t already well documented or researched by communities outside of the Global North
>
> If you’ve answered all of these with a “yes”, you are ready to start working with your community!
