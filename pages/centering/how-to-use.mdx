## A guide to Human Rights Centered Design

Welcome to our guide! In it, we will share chapters, resources, and exercises to help support you as you incorporate human rights centered design into your work.

The guide consists of 5 phases, with a few sections in each that cover different parts of the design, research, and building process, with interviews, case studies, exercises, and theory within the human rights community. These sections are based on phases of the research/ideation/design/release process and include:

- Phase 1: Centering Human Rights
- Phase 2: Research
- Phase 3: Prototyping and Building
- Phase 4: Release / Launch / Iteration
- Phase 5: Looking to the Future / Sustainability

They can be followed sequentially or out of order, for whatever suits your needs. However, we do recommend going in our chapter order, since the later chapters reference findings in the earlier chapters.

_An Important Note: We initially created this resource for human rights activists, but it can be used by anyone._

However, it’s important to stress that these materials were designed for a specific audience, e.g. human rights activists; **meaning, there are some pre-steps that a non-human rights audience should be taking that this guide does not get into.** This guide is made with the idea in mind that if you are using our materials, you have already been working in the problem area you’re exploring for a while, and you already have connections and relationships with the community or users related to the problem area you are exploring, and you’ve already explored dived into some of the policy and security concerns of that problem area. This guide is designed to help build off of that pre-existing knowledge, and apply design focused and privacy focused exercises to improve whatever technology you’re building or research you’re conducting.

That being said, we’ve created supplemental materials (featured at the bottom of every chapter) for a more general or non-human rights audience to help contextualize the exercises, and provide some guidance or suggestions to better engage with the materials.

#### Some Things to Keep in Mind:

> You may be coming to this as an expert, with years of experience, or as a newbie, but remember always ask (and ensure) ‘how do you know’ and ‘did someone ask for this’ in your research experience. ‘How Do You Know’ is a great question to also check our assumptions, even assumptions we make about our own work as experts. ‘Did Someone Ask for This’ is another great way to ensure we are building tools that communities need, and then building WITH communities to ensure those tools are useful, and usable for communities.

> We are going to be covering a slew of topics, from design to security to human rights, so we recommend going at a pace that feels good to you. Take notes, write out your thoughts, and take breaks - if that feels right to you!

> We hope our guide will help you better center human rights in your work!
