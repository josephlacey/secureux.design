The Human Rights Centered Design Curriculum

Hello!

Are you an organization building, designing and researching technology for vulnerable or at-risk people? Are you a designer or product manager keen to learn how to center human rights within technology? Our curriculum is for you! Based on extensive research with these communities to build and refine products, we are offering: best practices, use cases, and knowledge from human rights activists, community organizers, and technologists from across the globe.

We are part of a growing community of human rights researchers, activists and designers. Our curriculum is inspired by and sits on the shoulders of the human rights centered design community, the Design Justice Community, the Consensual technology movement, the Internet Freedom and Privacy Community, open source technology, data feminism, as well as others.
