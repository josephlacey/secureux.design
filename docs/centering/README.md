# Phase 1: Centering Human Rights

Phase 1 will help you to figure out the problem the community you are working with is facing and whether or not you are able to help them solve it.

It will also help answer the following questions:

- What are the most ethical ways to perform research when building tools or services with and for the communities you serve?
- How do you determine safety and security when working with a new community?
- What are some real-world lessons learned from those we’ve worked with in the past?

Lastly, it will teach you how to threat-model to determine the most prevalent threats your communities face.
