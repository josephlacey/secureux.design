        more extreme violations like genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and

        Co-design is about challenging the imbalance of power held within groups
        of individuals, who make important decisions about others lives,
        livelihoods and bodies. Often, with little to no involvement of the
        people who will be most impacted by those decisions. Co-design seeks to
        change that through building new relationships, capability and capacity
        for boundless curiosity. It uses inclusive convening to share knowledge
        and power.

        The decentralized web is an abstract concept sought by several

        order to remove centralized data hosting services, using instead a
        peer-to-peer infrastructure. Interest in the decentralized web arose due
        to the lack of trust in network maintenance organizations, due to
        scandals involving widespread espionage and content control.
