    Co-design

    chapter 4

    Co-design is about challenging the imbalance of power held within groups of individuals, who make important decisions about
    others lives, livelihoods and bodies. Often, with little to no involvement of the people who will be most impacted by those decisions. Co-design seeks
    to change that through building new relationships, capability and capacity for boundless curiosity. It uses inclusive convening to share knowledge and power.
